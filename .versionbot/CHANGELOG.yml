    - subject: Deduce submodule update versions automatically
      hash: 996fe604f48b6af47d9af04fa8e9cb5501711248
      body: >
        The nested changelog support currently needs to be provided with the

        version range on the commit body, similarly to:

          Update <submodule> from <initialVersion> to <targetVersion>

        This is cumbersome and does not work well with tools that automatically

        update submodule dependencies like renovatebot.


        This commit keeps the legacy behaviour but will extract the version range

        from git metadata when not provided. This new behaviour can be used by

        specifyng a commit body similar to:

          Update <submodule>

        We are doing more heavy regex processing now.

        First the package name is extracted from Cargo.toml. It is located in the  `[package]` section of Cargo.toml. The package name is used for detecting the proper `version = "..."` definition in Cargo.lock. Cargo.lock is generated automatically, so `version` always follows `name`, and the code takes advantage of that fact for simplification purposes.

        The proper `version = "..."` definition in Cargo.toml is inside the `[package]` section, so the regex looks for first occurrence after `[package]`.

        If we repeatedly call Versionist from the beginning of a project, all
        the commits so far will be added over and over again.
        The reason for this is that we default the start commit for
        `versionist.readCommitHistory()` to `null` if a reference is not found,
        independently on if it corresponds to the default initial version or
        not.
        To solve this issue, we only default the start commit to `null` if no
        documented version was found on the repository.

        Making sure that a non-zero exit code from the CLI test cases halts the

        before being able to use it directly to perform a commit.

        Recent commits introduced plenty features, like automatic `CHANGELOG`
        and `package.json` editing.
        The example from the `README.md` was updated to showcase this feature.
        In order to make sure there are always enough changes to get something
        generated, we added an `example` annotated tag and instruct the user to
        `checkout` it.

        This option hook is used to resolve a git reference out of a semantic
        version. For example, you may create annotated git tags for each version
        using the following convention: `vx.y.z`.
        In order to resolve a `x.y.z` semantic version, you could declare a hook
        that simply prepends a `v`.
        In more complex use cases, this hook could traverse the git history or
        available tags.

        Using Versionist is very manual. We require users to manually specify
        the range of commits to be parsed with the `--from` and `--to` CLI
        arguments.
        Since the addition of the `getChangelogDocumentedVersions` hook, we can
        use the information returned by that function to automatically infer
        these values.
        The CLI doesn't have the `--from`/`--to` options anymore and instead:
        - Defaults `--to` to `HEAD`.
        - Defaults `--from` to the greater version returned by
        `getChangelogDocumentedVersions`.

        We were currently blindly passing the version the user sets as the
        `--current` option to the Handlebars template, without imposing any
        validation or normalisation.
        This would cause problems with invalid semver versions, or if the user
        sometimes passes a version preppended with a `v` and sometimes not,
        since the data passed to the template would not always be consistent.
        This PR introduces a function called `semver.normalize()`, which returns
        the normalised version, or throws if the version is not valid.

        Currently, `gitLog.getGitLogCommandThatOutputsYaml()` returns a string
        containing the full command to get parseable `git log` output.
        This is inconvenient since we can't use functions like
        `child_process.spawn()` that take an array of arguments instead of a
        full string with ease, or use a custom `git` binary path.
        This commit introduces the following changes:
        - Rename `getGitLogCommandThatOutputsYaml()` to
        `getGitLogCommandArgumentsThatOutputYaml()`
        - Make `getGitLogCommandThatOutputsYaml()` return an array of string
        arguments, *omitting* the `git` binary
        - Remove the double quotes around the `--pretty` format, since its not
        necessary to escape it anymore.

        Since this limit can be easily reached when runnign Versionist on huge

        We specify a very particular `git log` format through a complex
        `--pretty` format in `git-log.js`.
        This means that if we do any change to the format, we have to edit
        dozens of tests suites accordingly.
        In order to mitigate this issue, we create a function that given a
        commit subject and body generates output similar to out `--pretty`
        format.
        This way, if we ever change our format, we only have to update the tests
        suite in a single place.

        There are some commits we've seen in the wild while using this module
        that indent the body for some reason (a space or two spaces usually).
        For example:
        ```
        My commit
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
        Hello world.
        Fixes: #350
        ```
        This confuses the YAML parser, since applying our custom `git log
        --pretty` format to such commits yields:
        ```
        - subject >-
        My commit
        body: |-
        Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
        Hello world.
        Fixes: #350
        ```
        Which of course is not well indented.
        We've considered moving away from YAML to another serialisation
        technology that copes with these kind of multi-line string issues,
        however we found a small workaround that allows us to not spend time
        building and maintaing something else:
        If we pass *any* dummy string as the first line of `body`, and make it
        well indented, the remaining of the body will be parsed correctly.
        Therefore, we tweak our parser to pass a dummy `XXX`, and implement code
        in the parser to omit it.
